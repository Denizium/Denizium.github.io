            <p class="content">
                Aside from being a fun way to spend an afternoon with your family and friends, table tennis also
                offers surprisingly great health benefits. Like most sports, table tennis offers great mind-body
                stimulation, aerobic exercise, and social interaction.  Unlike many sports, however, the overall risk
                for injury with table tennis is quite low.An intense game of table tennis stimulates mental alertness
                and concentration and develops mental acuity.Due to the fast-paced, short-distance nature of the
                sport, both gross and fine muscle movements are improved. Table tennis is the perfect choice for people
                who had knee surgery, history of back problems, or simply those who are tired of twisting their ankles
                while playing some other sports.Social interaction is very important for mental health. In a world so
                connected through technology, people are feeling more and more disconnected from each other.
                Table tennis offers you a chance to, step away from the screen, and bond with the person
                on the other side of the ping pong table.

                2) Billiards
            </p>
            <p class="content">
                A casual game known for its ubiquitous presence in bars and pubs (even coining the name pool hall),
                billiards is a catchall term for the tabletop game played that requires pool sticks (or cues) to hit
                hard balls into one of six pockets. The game can be played casually, as an amateur and even on the
                professional level. Each round of billiards, whatever game type one chooses to play, is uniquely
                presented and requires players to be mentally agile and physically adept.Playing pool requires a great
                amount of focus and concentration. Your ability to focus on a given objective is essential in achieving
                happiness and attaining goals. In billiards, players must focus on their targets (the cue ball and the
                target ball), the angle of their own cue, the angle the cue ball will move in once it is hit and if the
                cue ball will strike the target ball.

                </p>
            <p class="content">
                Snowboarding is an incredibly thrilling activity and a popular winter sport. When the temperature drops,
                most people hibernate at their homes but once the skateboarding season is over, I love to go out and hit
                the slopes.
                Snowboarding provides full-body exercise and helps you burn calories, lose weight, and increase your
                endurance. It is a great cardiovascular exercise that can strengthen lower body muscles,
                improve flexibility, boost your mood, and build core muscles.
                Cardiovascular exercises lower the risk of chronic diseases and lower blood pressure.
                Moreover, it also helps in maintaining a healthy body weight.

                My favorite rock band:

                <p class="name_content2" id="vv">
                    1) Vopli Vidoplyasova
                </p>
            <p class="content">
                The band was formed in 1986 by guitarist Yuri Zdorenko and bassist Oleksandr Pipa, who had played in the
                band SOS since 1984. It took its name from Vidopliassov, a character from The Village of Stepanchikovo.
                The band had their first performance at the Kyiv rock club on 30 October 1987, with vocalist and
                accordionist Oleh Skrypka and drummer Serhiy Sakhno.
                The name of the new group was suggested by Pipa, who was then reading Dostoevsky:
                the character Grigory Vidoplyasov, in the novel “The Village of Stepanchikovo" writes compositions,
                filled with 'howls of the soul,' that he calls “Vopli Vidoplyasova”

                    2) Skryabin
                </p>
            <p class="content">
                Skryabin (Ukrainian: Скрябін, also transliterated as Scriabin or Skriabin) is a Ukrainian rock, pop band
                formed in 1989 in Novoyavorivsk, Ukraine. Prominent Ukrainian musician Andriy "Kuzma" Kuzmenko
                (Ukrainian: Андрій Кузьменко) was the band's lead singer until his death in 2015.
                During its existence Skryabin has gone from synthpop to rock and pop music. As it progressed, the band's
                style has been divided into "classic Skryabin" and "new Skryabin". This transition took place
                between 2000-2003.
                The group was named "Best Pop Band" in 2006 at the "ShowBiz Awards” held in Kyiv's National Opera House.

                    3) Haydamaky
                </p>
            <p class="content">
                The Haydamaky began their career in 1991, shortly after Ukraine declared its independence.
                Then the band was known as Aktus, and played mostly local gigs in the underground Kyiv music scene.
                Without a fertile, popular local music scene, Aktus turned to the sounds of reggae, ska, and punk music
                for a fresh alternative. Members of the band were also attracted to the political impact that these
                genres had on their society. The idea was that through music significant social change could be possible.
                This gave a greater purpose to the performance of such musical styles. The discovery of these musical
                genres later became the key to their own realization of a specifically Ukrainian musical style.
                Haydamaky's hope is to forge an inherently Ukrainian popular music style, which looks back to its own
                heritage and traditions as a source for inspiration.
